## User Segmentation
### Identify and Categorize Different Users
We currently focus on programmers of all skill levels. In the future, we may introduce user modes instead of categorizing by users.


### Identify Their Pain Points / Challenges / Needs / Preferences
- **Beginner Programmers:** Need clear explanations and interactive guidance.
- **Experienced Developers:** Require efficiency-boosting automation.
- **Educators & Tech Leads:** Need tools for reviewing and assisting students or team members.

### Prioritize Pain Points
#### MVP Priorities:
- **High Priority:** Reducing debugging complexity.
- **Medium Priority:** Enhancing multi-language support.
- **Low Priority:** Providing interactive learning features.


## Features
### High-Level Features that Address the Prioritized Pain Points
- **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Generates and refines code snippets.
- **Automated Debugging:** Highlights issues with solutions.
- **Customizable Assistance:** Allows users to tweak AI responses.
- **Unit Test Writing & Test Case Generation:** Automates testing to improve code quality.

### Unique Selling Point (USP)
- **Real-time AI assistance for debugging, test case generation, and code optimization.**

### Feature Prioritization
Using the **MoSCoW** method:
- **Must Have:** AI-powered test case generation, debugging, and real-time suggestions.
- **Should Have:** Collaborative coding features.
- **Could Have:** Integration with IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains.
- **Won't Have (for now):** AI voice coding assistance.

### User Flow and Interaction Design
#### 3.1 Code Writing & AI Assistance
- User writes code in the editor.
- AI provides suggestions, error detection, and auto-completions.
- The user can accept, modify, or reject suggestions.


#### 3.2 Test Case Generation
- AI analyzes the written code in real time.
- It generates test cases dynamically and presents them in the Test Case Generator Panel.
- The user can edit or accept test cases before execution.

#### 3.3 Debugging Workflow
- AI detects potential errors and displays them in the Debugging Console.
- Possible fixes and explanations are provided.
- The user applies fixes manually or accepts AI-generated solutions.

## System Design and Architecture
